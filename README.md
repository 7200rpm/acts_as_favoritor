# acts_as_favoitor - Add Favorites to you Rails app

<img src="https://travis-ci.org/slooob/acts_as_favoritor.svg?branch=master" />

acts_as_favoritor is a Rubygem to allow any ActiveRecord model to favorite any other model. This is accomplished through a double polymorphic relationship on the Favorite model. There is also built in support for blocking/un-blocking favorite records.

## Installation

acts_as_favoritor works with Rails 4.0 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'acts_as_favoritor'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install acts_as_favoritor

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'amphtml', github: 'slooob/acts_as_favoritor'
```

Now run the generator:

    $ rails g acts_as_follower

    $ rails db:migrate

This will create a Favorite model as well as a migration file.

**Note:** Use `rake db:migrate` instead if you run Rails < 5.
